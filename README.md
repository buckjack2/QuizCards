Quiz Cards

Remember those flashcards you used in school? Where you
had a question on one side and the answer on the back?
They aren’t much help when you’re trying to understand
something, but nothing beats ‘em for raw drill-and-practice
and rote memorization. When you have to burn in a fact. And
they’re also great for trivia games
